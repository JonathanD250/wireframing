# wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application.  
It outlines the structure and layout of pages before design elements like colors, typography, and images are added.

## Importance of Wireframing
- Provides a clear blueprint for developers and designers.  
- Saves time by identifying layout and navigation issues early.  
- Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- Helps prioritise content and functionality.  
- Acts as a foundation for creating prototypes and final designs.
