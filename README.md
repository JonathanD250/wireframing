# wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application.  
It outlines the structure and layout of pages before design elements like colors, typography, and images are added.

## Importance of Wireframing
- Provides a clear blueprint for developers and designers.  
- Saves time by identifying layout and navigation issues early.  
- Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- Helps prioritise content and functionality.  
- Acts as a foundation for creating prototypes and final designs.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

When creating a wireframe, four key elements form the foundation of the design:

### 1. Layout Structure
- Defines the overall arrangement of the page or screen.  
- Determines where the header, footer, sidebars, and main content area will be placed.  
- Example: A homepage wireframe might have a top navigation bar, a large hero section in the centre, and a footer with contact information.

### 2. Navigation
- Shows how users move between different sections or pages.  
- Includes menus, links, and buttons that guide users.  
- Example: A booking system wireframe may display a top navigation bar with links to "Home," "Bookings," and "Profile."

### 3. Content Placement
- Identifies where text, images, videos, and other content blocks will appear.  
- Helps prioritise the hierarchy of information.  
- Example: On a product page, the product image is placed on the left while the description and price appear on the right.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be divided into two main categories: **Low-Fidelity** and **High-Fidelity**. Each type serves a different purpose in the design process.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Simple and quick sketches that focus on structure and layout rather than detail.  
- Often created using pen and paper or basic digital tools.  
- Used early in the design process to brainstorm and communicate ideas.  
- Example: Boxes representing images and lines representing text without worrying about fonts, colors, or exact sizing.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- More detailed and closer to the final product.  
- Show typography, spacing, colors, and sometimes interactive elements.  
- Used later in the design process to refine design decisions and share with stakeholders for approval.  
- Example: A polished wireframe of a landing page with actual text, button labels, and precise spacing.

## Identifying the Wireframe Type

The example provided here is a **High-Fidelity Wireframe**.  
- It includes detailed content, button placement, and accurate spacing.  
- It is used to test user interaction and get realistic feedback before moving into full development.

### 4. Functionality
- Highlights interactive elements and how they should behave.  
- Includes buttons, forms, input fields, dropdowns, and checkboxes.  
- Example: In a checkout page wireframe, the "Proceed to Payment" button is clearly shown below the order summary.
